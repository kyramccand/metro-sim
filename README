Program Purpose:

    To implement the Passenger and PassengerQueue classes that my final
    simulator of the Green Line will be built off of.


Acknowledgements: 

    I used the website at the URL below to learn about std::lists for my
    implementation of the PassengerQueue class, as well as reviewing the Queues
    lecture slides from Monday.



Files: 

Passenger.h: Interface of the Passenger class.

Passenger.cpp: Implementation of the Passenger class.

PassengerQueue.h: Interface of the PassengerQueue class.

PassengerQueue.cpp: Implemenation of the PassengerQueue class.

unit_tests.h: A unit testing file for the Passenger and PassengerQueue classes.
    Runs in conjunction with the unit_test framework to allow for testing of 
    individual functions.


Data Structures:
    
    The main abstract data structure of Phase 1 of MetroSim is a queue, which
    is an ordered list of elements that is added and removed from using the
    FIFO (first in first out) rule. I implemented the PassengerQueue class
    as an std::list of Passenger objects because std::lists are doubly linked
    with a back pointer, and thus have more efficient pop_front and push_back
    functionalities, which are the two operations that a queue performs
    repeatedly.


Testing:
    
    I tested the functions of the Passenger and Passenger queue class both
    manually (I wrote some tester code in main.cpp), as well as automatically
    using the provided unit_test framework. Upon looking at the project spec
    pdf, I wasn't sure whether printing a PassengerQueue object had spaces
    between the printing of each Passener, but after inspecting the reference
    program's output, I realized that they do not have spaces between them.
    I suppose this was the most challenging bug that I encountered while testing
    thus far.


Time Spent: 5 hours
